# SPROUTIFY

Sproutify is an app which visualizes your spotify behaviour. Your most listened tracks of a selected timerange will draw a landscape filled with fractal trees.

Day or night is determined by the amount of tracks in major or minor. Spring or autumn represents more cheerful songs or melancholic songs. Each tree represents one track. The anatomy of the tree is determined by a few factors. Big trees are more energetic tracks. The number of recursions is dependent on the amount of bars. Trees on the right are more instrumental and the trees higher up in the mountains, are more acoustic tracks.

The fractal trees are based on Daniel Shiffman's book [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/)
